The order book for the sale peaked at more than $23 billion, a person with knowledge of the demand said. Proceeds from the bond sale are earmarked for general corporate purposes, including the financing of share buybacks and dividends, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.

Many of the big banks brought large debt sales after reporting earnings, helping supply beat expectations for the month. The momentum is expected to continue into this week with Wall Street syndicate desks expecting around $30 billion of new high-grade bond supply. Apple, one of eight companies that sold new high-grade bonds Monday, appears to be taking advantage of the recent stability and relatively cheaper cost of funding in the corporate market. The yield on Bloomberg’s benchmark investment-grade index hit a nearly two-month low on Friday. The iPhone maker’s cash and cash equivalents stockpile sits at nearly $180 billion, while it has paid out around $14 billion dividends each of the last three years. “Apple consistently borrowing tens of billions of dollars annually is due more to its confidence in expanding cash flow than operational needs,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffman wrote Monday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. managed the sale. In December, Apple’s long-term credit was upgraded to Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service, putting it in an exclusive club with Microsoft Corp. and Johnson & Johnson as the only US corporations in the S&P 500 with the highest possible credit rating.

       "  'U.S. stocks were mostly flat in a choppy session Friday following the release of June employment data that topped expectations. The U.S. economy created 372,000 jobs in June while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6% last month, data published Friday morning showed. All three major indexes hovered below breakeven as of 3:29 p.m. ET after swinging between gains and losses throughout the trading day. Treasury yields were higher, with two-year yields rising to 3.11%, further inverting the yield curve; 10-year yields were trading near 3.01%. Investors seemed to take Friday\\'s stronger-than-expected jobs data as a sign the Federal Reserve will remain resolute in its plans to aggressively raise interest rates, with another 0.75% increase in its benchmark rate likely coming later this month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected payroll gains would total 268,000 last month, the smallest of the pandemic recovery but well above the pre-COVID average of about 164,000 per month throughout 2019. The unemployment rate was forecast to hold steady at 3.6%. \"The June employment report reassuringly showed that despite increasing recession concerns, the labor market remains strong,\" Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a note to clients following the report.

       "  'By Peter Nurse Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Friday, with investors cautious ahead of the release of a key monthly jobs report which could guide future Federal Reserve policy. At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.3% lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures declined 65 points, or 0.5%. The major Wall Street indices closed with significant gains Thursday, rallying on hopes that falls in the prices of major commodities like crude oil and copper pointed to inflationary trends already peaking. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 350 points, or 1.1%, higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.3%, and the broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.5%, its fourth consecutive positive day, matching the longest winning streak of the year so far. Yet, despite the recent gains, recession fears remain strong with the Federal Reserve signaling in the minutes of its June policy meeting earlier this week that it was prepared to raise rates another 50-75 basis points at its meeting later this month in a bid to tame inflation. Ahead of this comes the June jobs report, at 08:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to show that the economy added 268,000 positions during the month, a slowing down from the 390,000 jobs created in May. The unemployment rate is seen staying at 3.6%, while average hourly earnings, a gauge of inflationary pressures, are expected to grow 0.3% month over month, unchanged from May.

The S&P 500 rose 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%, or 345 points, the Nasdaq was up 2.3% Energy stocks clawed back some of their recent losses as oil prices shrugged off data showing U.S. weekly crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 8.2 million barrels in the week ended July 1. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), and APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) were among the biggest gainers with the latter up more than 7% Chip stocks rose more than 4% to push the broader tech sector higher after Samsung’s better-than-feared results and guidance lifted worries about the outlook for chip demand. Samsung forecast a 11.4% rise in second-quarter operating profit from the prior year, with revenue expected to rise by 20.9% in the quarter year-on-year. Still, some on Wall Street aren’t convinced. “We are less inclined to see positive derivatives from [Samsung’s] better than expected profit number, particularly given memory peer Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) solid FQ3 result and soft FQ4 guide,” Wedbush said. The ongoing strength in tech comes even as Treasury yields tacked on gains despite expectations for aggressive Fed Rate hikes dissipating following recent data showing a slowing economy and signs that inflation could be peaking. “[W]hile the Fed remains focused on inflation, the reversal in market pressures could offer the Committee cover if they did decide to make a smaller move in July,” Stifel said. Initial jobless claims ticked up to the highest level since January, though analysts continued to note that the labor market remains tight. Jobless claims are “still very low relative to history, and it is consistent with tight labor market conditions,” Jefferies said in a note.

       "  'The usually quiet month of August this week kicks off with a trial Monday over the Justice Department\\'s antitrust lawsuit challenging Penguin Random House\\'s pending acquisition of rival Simon & Schuster. We\\'re also watching Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\\'s countersuit against Twitter (TWTR), which he filed Friday as part of his ongoing efforts to walk away from his $44 billion agreement to acquire the social media site. And after more than a year of delays, Boeing (BA) reportedly has the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s clearance on its plan to repair and resume deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner. Here\\'s more on the three legal stories we\\'re watching this week: Penguin Random House, the world\\'s largest book publisher, is scheduled to begin a trial in Washington, DC, on Monday to defend the Justice Department’s federal antitrust lawsuit seeking to stop its $2.2 billion deal to acquire rival Simon & Schuster. The deal, reached in 2020, would reduce the number of U.S. publishers from five to four. The Justice Department contends the deal would allow Penguin Random House to control close to half the market for publishing rights acquisitions — leaving consumers with fewer choices. The department also argues that the deal would drive down compensation paid to authors for their work. The legendary novelist Stephen King — author of books including \"The Shining,\" \"Carrie,\" and \"Misery\" — is slated to testify on behalf of the government. Musk struck back against Twitter (TWTR) on Friday in a countersuit as part of his ongoing efforts to avoid going through with his deal to buy the company for $44 billion. The Tesla (TSLA) CEO filed the counterclaim confidentially, hiding it from public view. A counterclaim could frustrate the case’s timeline already set for trial in October, given that time is generally set for the parties to exchange and review documents. Last week the Delaware Chancery Court’s chief judge granted Twitter an expedited trial to take place over five days in October. The judge also granted Musk’s request for an Oct. 17 start date.

       "  \"By Ambar Warrick Investing.com-- Shares of Chinese battery material suppliers Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co Ltd (SS:603799) and CNGR Advanced Material Co Ltd (SZ:300919) jumped on Monday after the two signed separate supply agreements with electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Zhejiang Huayou’s shares jumped nearly 9%, while those of CNGR advanced over 6% after the announcements. While both firms are already listed as official suppliers by Tesla, the new deal will see them expand their sales to the electric vehicle maker. Zhejiang Huayou will supply to Tesla between 2022 and 2025, while CNGR's agreement will be between 2023 and 2025. Tesla has a sizeable presence in China, with a major manufacturing hub in Shanghai. The Tesla Model Y is also among the best-selling passenger vehicles in China. A series of COVID-related lockdowns in the Shanghai factory had seen CEO Elon Musk urge staff to work harder and make up for a rough quarter. Tesla's new deal with the battery material providers comes amid a growing number of auto manufacturers pivoting into electric vehicles, which is expected to weigh on the supply of the materials used in manufacturing batteries. Zhejiang Huayou sources cobalt from sites in Zhejiang, as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo. The firm is also listed as a cobalt supplier to iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In July, the firm also signed a supply agreement with Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) - as the carmaker aims to ramp up its electric vehicle offerings with the new F-150 electric truck. CNGR owns sites in Congo, Zambia, and Canada, and sells to clients in the United States, Europe, and parts of Asia. Zhejiang Huayou and CNGR both outpaced broader Chinese stocks, which rose despite mixed economic indicators. The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 blue-chip index added about 0.5%.

With TSLH, Innovator seeks to provide a risk-managed approach to investing in Tesla (TSLA), which has been one of the most popular and best performing large-cap stocks in the market, but also one of the most volatile2. The ETF’s strategy will seek to solve for the large historical drawdowns in shares of the electric vehicle leader, offering potentially substantial upside exposure to TSLA during periods when the stock rises while attempting to limit downside risk by targeting a protective floor against TSLA losses greater than approximately 10% per quarter. There is no guarantee that the fund will be successful in implementing the strategy. The ETF will not invest directly in TSLA, but rather in options tied to the company. An investor's possible return profile in TSLH will also depend on the time at which such investor purchases and sells shares of the ETF. “While there is little doubt Teslas are amazingly sleek, smooth-driving vehicles, the very volatile ride in the shares of the electric vehicle (EV) leader leaves a lot to be desired for advisors and their clients who are not accustomed to such a rough road.

       "  'Some storm clouds are appearing on the horizon for Tesla bulls after a respectable second quarter. \"The elephant in the room for Tesla (and the broader market) is with dark economic storm clouds on the horizon and Musk himself thinking recession risk is imminent, what does this mean for Tesla\\'s demand story going forward?\" Wedbush Wedbush\\xa0Senior Equity Research Analyst Dan Ives stated in a new note to clients. \"In a nutshell, while June delivery numbers were ugly and nothing to write home about, the Street will be focused on the trajectory for the second half... and the overall demand picture staying firm.\" The electric vehicle maker said over the weekend that second quarter deliveries tallied 254,695. While that represented about 27% year over year growth, it fell short of analyst estimates for 256,520. In a note, Citi Itay Michaeli pinned the miss on a shortfall in deliveries of Tesla\\'s Model 3 and Model Y. The electric vehicle company\\'s performance was held back by an array of issues affecting the auto industry, ranging from semiconductor shortages to COVID restrictions in China. Tesla\\'s second quarter suggests demand hasn\\'t begun to reflect consumer concerns around a recession. In fact, it\\'s reasonable to say Tesla\\'s results would have been stronger if not for supply chain challenges constraining demand. But analysts generally agree that if demand were to slow noticeably in the second half of the year, it could add pressure to Tesla\\'s bottom line at a time of high costs. That would likely hit the stock, which is down 35% so far in 2022. \"We suspect that the interplay of price and cost may matter most for Tesla earnings this year,\" JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note to clients. \"This interplay we believe presents downside risk to 2Q, given that Tesla experienced sharp battery metals inflation (as well as higher other commodity and non-commodity supply chain costs) but the price hikes of upwards of $10K it announced across its lineup generally apply only to new orders and not to existing reservations (as Rivian tried unsuccessfully earlier this year); however, as the',\n",
       "  'In a surprising move to even Capitol Hill insiders, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia struck a deal on a reconciliation bill, which among other things includes $369 billion on energy and climate spending. Of note for automakers like GM (GM), Tesla (TSLA), Toyota (TM) and others is new money for the expansion of the $7,500 federal EV (electric vehicle) tax credit. Currently Tesla and GM are no longer eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs because they have hit the 200,000 unit threshold for the credit. Other automakers like Toyota, Nissan (7201.T), and Ford (F) are also on the verge of losing the credit as well. The new deal removes the 200,000 unit threshold, allowing GM and Tesla to once again receive those full benefits, however there are some limitations. The tax credits are now more targeted towards lower priced EVs, and those people under a certain income threshold. According to the draft of the bill, the full $7,500 EV credit only applies to these vehicles: Vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks costing less than $80,000 Others, meaning sedans and coupes, costing less than $55,000 The income thresholds for receiving the full tax credit are $300,000 in adjusted gross income for joint filers, or $150,000 for individual filers. Also of note is the inclusion of a new federal tax credit of $4,000 for used EVs. The full tax credit is also conditioned upon the vehicle being assembled in North America, and for battery components and materials coming from North America or countries with free trade deals with the U.S. The battery materials sourcing requirements will be phased in over time, according to the deal. Democrats still have many questions to answer in the coming days before they can ensure that the deal — which requires the full support of Democrats —will actually get passed. The first is whether Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) will support it. She has been critical of tax increases in the past and was apparently not included in the secret talks in recent weeks.

       "  'It will be make-or-break for Tesla (TSLA) come Wednesday after the bell, as the electric vehicle maker releases its second quarter earnings report. The Street is expecting Tesla to report Q2 Revenue: $16.88 billion Q2 Adjusted EPS: $1.83 That revenue figure would represent a 2.5% drop from a year ago, which is not that severe considering the production issues Tesla experienced during Q2 due to COVID-related shutdowns at its Shanghai Gigafactory. On the profitability end, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income, operating profit, and EBITDA figures that are all down over 10% from a year ago. On the positive side, investors will be more focused on the path ahead for Tesla, looking at what CEO Elon Musk and execs have to say about Q3 and the second half of 2022. Questions that will be top of mind will center around ramp ups at the Giga Texas and Giga Berlin plants, whether Giga China is back to full operating capacity, and whether Tesla will reaffirm its 2022 delivery target of 50% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) year over year. Maintaining that rate would mean Tesla will delivery around 1.4 to 1.5 million vehicles in 2022. In a note to clients yesterday, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote that he expects Tesla will maintain its annual delivery target, which he says implies “considerable volume ramp in the second half.\" Rosner added Tesla to the firm’s short-term “Catalyst Call Buy List,” advising clients to accumulate shares following Tesla’s pullback this year. As of this afternoon, Tesla stock is down 31% year to date, though it is still up 10% over the past year. As far as future models go, investors, analysts, and Tesla fans will be eager to hear any updates on volume production of the Cybertruck, which is slated for production next year and whether the “robotaxi” product Musk had mentioned in last quarter’s earnings call was still on target for a 2024 launch.

Sergey Brin Ordered Sale of Musk Investments After Affair: WSJ Trump Is Plotting to Blow Up the Constitution Fed to Inflict More Pain on Economy as It Readies Big Rate Hike Shallow Recession Calls Are ‘Totally Delusional,’ Roubini Warns The Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF (ticker TSLH) is set to launch on the Cboe on Tuesday, and seeks to tap into gains in the carmaker while limiting quarterly losses to 10%. It will invest about 90% of its assets in Treasury bills and 10% in options through a strategy known as call-option spreads, which involves buying in-the-money calls and selling out-of-the-money bullish contracts. While the fund looks to provide a floor to losses in Tesla, it would also cap positive returns. Under recent market conditions, a strategy similar to the one for TSLH would provide about a 10% quarterly cap on gains, according to estimates by the fund’s issuer, Innovator Capital Management LLC. Since the fund is listing at the end of July, the maximum gain this calendar quarter for people who invest at the launch is estimated to be 8.7%. “There is no guarantee that the fund will be successful in implementing the strategy,” Innovator warned in a statement. Investors’ returns will also differ depending on the time at which they buy and sell shares of TSLH during each calendar quarter. Tesla’s stock is down more than 20% this year alongside the bear market in equities, although it’s fared better than some other megacap names such as Alphabet Inc. and automakers like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. A better-than-expected earnings report helped Elon Musk’s company rally in recent days.

       "  'Tesla (TSLA) stock was up over 9% Thursday afternoon, as the electric vehicle maker reported a better quarter than feared, given production challenges in China, component shortages, and the resources it\\'s using to gear up production at new factories in Austin and Berlin. In Tesla’s shareholder letter, the company noted that its installed annual capacity, or theoretical max production, increased by nearly two-fold. Tesla\\'s Fremont production capacity expanded to 650,000 vehicles from 600,000 last quarter, and Giga Shanghai’s capacity grew to 750,000 from 450,000. Meanwhile, production of vehicles ramped up in both Austin and Berlin, with Tesla now claiming each factory has an installed capacity for 250,000 vehicles. Overall, Tesla says it could theoretically deliver nearly 2 million of its EVs per year — a massive figure for a company that delivered 936,000 vehicles in 2021. Still, one analyst thinks that goal may be overly ambitious. “Tesla is still in an elongated demand cycle; it\\'s not like there\\'s a bunch of vehicles sitting on the lot. I think demand is strong,” says Jeffrey Osborne, Cowen senior research analyst. Still, he added, “I\\'m not sure it\\'s running at a 2 million run rate they\\'re talking about, especially with the portfolio being a bit stale in my view.\" Osborne predicts Tesla will hit that production rate by the fourth quarter of 2023, citing production capacity in Germany and Texas as one concern. Still, on Tesla\\'s earnings call on Wednesday, Tesla Powertrain and Energy Engineering head Andrew Bagliano expressed optimism regarding the Austin and Berlin ramp-ups. “We’ve grown cell production significantly on a 12-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts with all our partners for key battery metals, so we don’t see any major problems for the components, of course, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns,” he said. Tesla aims to deliver roughly 1.5 million vehicles in 2022, an ambitious figure compared to the 936,172 deliveries it reported last year. Given that Tesla delivered 310,000 vehicles in the first quarter and 250,000 in the second, the company would need to deliver a relatively ambitious 900,000 vehicles in the second half of 2022 — almost doubling',\n",
       "  'Hypergrowth tech stocks led last year’s market (and several years prior) to all-time highs. In 2022, some of the same companies proved to be a lucrative trade again – but this time, among short sellers. Research from S3 Partners Research (S3) shows that in June, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) were the most profitable shorted stocks, each churning out mark-to-market profits of more than $1 billion for traders betting on their declines. Short sellers borrow shares of a company they speculate will decline and sell them in anticipation the stock price will fall, with a goal of purchasing them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference. The winning streak for technology shorts came amid a sharp market decline in the broader market that saw the Nasdaq shed 8.7% during the month and log its worst first six months of the year on record. As technology stocks tanked during a rout in the sector this year, bets against some of the biggest companies in the space churned out roughly $20 billion in profits for short sellers, per S3’s data. In the prior two years, bets against mega-cap tech stocks saw a $36 billion loss as these companies rallied sharply. The downturn in U.S. equities more generally in 2022 has been a win for traders betting against the stock market. U.S. equity short-sellers were up 30% for the year through the end of June, according to the financial data and analytics firm. And while these traders continue to outperform the broader markets, short interest declined by $73.5 billion in June: from $981.6 billion in May to $908.1 billion. Investors continued to place new short bets but scaled back to $20 billion last month, compared to $65.5 billion of additional short selling in May. “This may be a sign that short sellers are sensing that a market bottom is near, and they are satisfied seeing their overall short exposure shrink slightly as the market value of their existing short positions decline ahead of what may be a possible market rally,” S3’s Ihor Dusaniwsky and Matthew Unterman stated in the',\n",

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. A little over a year ago, I was shopping with my son. He's a college student and was 22 at the time. We went to the mall to buy new clothes, and we stopped by the Tesla dealership. My son absolutely loves Elon Musk and is obsessed with Tesla, and I ended up walking out with a Tesla Model Y from 2021. My favorite feature of the car is that it's very comfortable. I love the white interior, and I got the white exterior too, which I think looks very sharp. I also love the Toybox, a tech menu that shows all the cool Tesla electronics features such as the Boombox, which can play audio inside and outside the vehicle. Another feature that I love about the car is the app that shows where my kids are, and the speed they're driving. I do have a Volkswagen Beetle Convertible, but we needed a second car because I have two kids. I liked the idea of never having to go to a smelly gas station again.\\xa0I bought it for environmental reasons and not so much to save money at the gas pump, because at the time, gas wasn't really expensive.

       " 'BTC': [\"Ether has flipped bitcoin for the first time on the world's largest options market. Crypto-analysts see this as the latest signal that ethereum (USD-ETH) may soon overtake bitcoin in terms of market capitalisation rankings. At present bitcoin (USD-BTC), which fell on Tuesday by almost 2% to $22,800 (£18,077), has always topped cryptocurrency rankings by market capitalisation. As of the time of writing, bitcoin has a market cap of approximately $436bn compared with ethereum's $190bn. Ethereum, though, has followed bitcoin's slide: ether fell nearly 6% in the last 24 hours. Read more: Crypto live prices On Monday, the world's largest options exchange, Deribit, saw $5.7bn locked into ether options contracts. This is 32% higher than the $4.3bn locked into open bitcoin options trades on the same market. There are a lot more traders interested in trading ether over bitcoin ahead of the coming ethereum merge in September. The long-awaited 'merge' of ethereum will see the network become a fully 'proof of stake' blockchain. The merge is scheduled for September and will make ethereum a low-energy usage blockchain, as it will have abandoned the high-energy intensive 'proof of work' method for verifying transactions that was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto with the founding of bitcoin. The merge will not only dramatically improve ethereum's environmental impact, it will also pave the way for cheaper and more efficient transactions on the network. Ethereum's merge to proof of stake could open the blockchain to inward investment from institutional finance, which remained cautious in the past because of the carbon footprint associated with proof of work.

       "  'James Howells threw out a hard drive to a landfill in 2013 that contained 8,000 bitcoins. He has an $11 million business plan to excavate the drive and recover the bitcoins. The plan includes budget for two robotic dogs from Boston Dynamics. James Howells, the man who made headlines after he lost 8,000 bitcoins on a hard drive that he accidentally threw away, has a master plan to get his cryptocurrency back. Howells threw out the hard drive containing the bitcoins in 2013. It ended up in Howells\\' local landfill in Newport, Wales. In a new interview with Insider, Howells said he has put together an $11 million business plan to recover the hard drive, the value of which stands at roughly $176 million at time of writing — although the value of bitcoin can fluctuate. Howells told Insider his plan budgets for two robotic \"Spot\" dogs from Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics\\' Spot robot first became commercially available in June 2020, when it hit the market at $74,500 per unit. Since then Spot has been used to perform scans for construction projects, herd sheep, and patrol parks in Singapore to enforce social distancing. Howells told Insider the robots would be used both for security as roaming CCTV cameras and to scan the ground to search for his missing hard drive. He said the project would require two dogs so one could be on patrol while the other charges its battery. Howells said if the project does go ahead, he would like to name the robotic dogs \"Satoshi\" and \"Hal.\" Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for the person or group of people who created Bitcoin, and Hal Finney was the first-ever recipient of a bitcoin transaction. Howells told Insider he constructed his plan with the help of expert advisors and secured funding via two venture capitalists. He hopes it will help convince Newport City Council to allow him to excavate the landfill. The council has consistently denied Howells access to the landfill since 2013, and his chances still look slim. A council spokesperson told Insider there is \"nothing that Mr. Howells',\n",

       "  'By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh (Reuters) - It\\'s been a good month for bitcoin - and we haven\\'t said that for a while. After months of freefall, it jumped more than 17% in July, its best performance since October. Ether rose 57%, its strongest monthly gain since January 2021. The rally was in step with gains of riskier assets such as stocks as investors bet that economic weakness could deter the Fed from aggressively tightening monetary policy. Bitcoin\\'s 40-day correlation to the tech-focused Nasdaq now stands at 0.90 - up from 0.41 in January - where 1 means their prices move in perfect lockstep. The leading cryptocurrency has been consistently positively correlated with the Nasdaq since late November, unlike in previous years where it would routinely turn negative, meaning they moved in opposite directions. Itai Avneri, deputy CEO at cryptocurrency trading platform INX, described July\\'s convergence as \"good news\". \"It means institutional investors are looking at bitcoin like any other asset,\" he said. \"When the market turns - and it will turn – these institutions will come back and invest in crypto.\" Gains were not limited to bitcoin, as the value of the global cryptocurrency market crept back above $1.15 trillion last month, adding over $255 billion since the end of June, CoinGecko data showed. Assets under management in digital asset investment products rose 16.9% to $25.9 billion in July, reversing June\\'s decline of 36.8%, according to research firm CryptoCompare. However, trading has been thin - indicating plenty of investors gauge it\\'s too early to turn bullish in a deeply uncertain macro backdrop with inflation rampant, and America and Europe staring down the barrel of a recession, not to mention the implosion of some big crypto players. Average daily volumes across all digital asset investment products fell by 44.6% to $122 million, the lowest since September 2020, CryptoCompare found. \"On a medium-term horizon, we\\'re bearish (on crypto) despite the current bounce, this aligns with our stance on equities,\" researchers at MacroHive wrote on Friday, citing inflation, recession risks and rate hikes.

       "  \"James Howells was doing some housecleaning in 2013 when he mistakenly threw out a hard drive that contained 8,000 Bitcoin he had mined. At the time, it was a mistake that cost him anywhere from $108,000 to $8.6 million depending on when he tossed the drive (2013 was a particularly volatile year for Bitcoin). That’s enough to make anyone kick themselves. Bitcoin, though, has only gotten more expensive, meaning Howells' losses have continued to grow. Even with the recent crypto winter, they now stand at $187 million. And now, he’s launching an expedition to try and recover the lost drive. Howells is petitioning the Newport (Wales) City Council to allow him to dig up the landfill that contains the hard drive. It’s a needle in a very large, very dirty haystack, filled with 110,000 tons of garbage. But if he convinces the city to let him conduct the search, he has a pair of venture capitalists ready to put up $11 million to conduct the excavation. The city, for years, has denied Howells’ request, saying the ecological impact would be too severe. With the current plan, which includes robot dogs and an A.I.-powered scanner, Howells says he believes that would be minimized. He has also vowed to build a solar station above the landfill when the search is complete. Should the Council approve this plan and the disk be found, and should the data on it be recoverable (any one of which is far from certain), Howells won’t walk away with the full $187 million. Under the terms of the deal, he and his VC partners would both keep 30% (roughly $56 million each), the team members who assist in the search would receive a portion, and each of Newport’s 150,000 citizens would receive £50. It wouldn’t be the first time that a treasure (albeit of a different kind) was found in a dump.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin declined after reaching the highest levels since mid-June on Saturday amid optimism that the market may have recovered from its worst levels. Most Read from Bloomberg Manchin Spending Deal Includes Billions in Oil Import Taxes You Won’t Like What Comes After Inflation Pelosi Is Expected to Visit Taiwan, Ramping Up US-China Tensions China’s Rebound Remains Fragile as Factories, Property Slump The largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 3.6% to $22,958 on Monday after breaking above $24,000 over the weekend, its highest since mid-June. Its 27% gain in July made for the best month since October. Ether slid more than 5% at the start of the week as well after posting a 70% jump last month, its best since January 2021. “August promises to be every bit as stomach-churning for Bitcoin with further bouts of volatility guaranteed,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at crypto lender Nexo. Yet he’s “leaning towards a re-run of July’s resilience over June’s capitulation” after “Bitcoin absorbed last week’s one-two macro punch” of the Federal Reserve rate hike and data showing the US economy contracted for a second consecutive quarter. Bitcoin had fallen below $20,000 during late June and July amid concern about interest-rate hikes and inflation, as well as troubles internal to cryptocurrencies, like the implosion of the Terra/Luna ecosystem and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Its still well off the record high around $69,000 from November, but has begun showing some strength of late as the stock market has also rallied. In July, the S&P 500 gained 9%, the most since November 2020. “Cryptos and equities have been positively correlated to one another, and that has especially been the case for the mega caps,” Jake Gordon at Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note at the end of last week. He cited solid earnings results from big-cap tech firms, which “likely assisted in boosting risk sentiment to lift cryptos higher.” Still, Bitcoin is hitting up against some major resistance points and its recent rally might not have legs, according to Katie Stockton, co-founder of Fairlead Strategies, a research firm focused',\n",

The original cost basis and market value of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin were $3.977 billion and $2.451 billion, respectively, which reflects an average cost per bitcoin of approximately $30,664 and a market price per bitcoin of $18,895.02, respectively.

The Nasdaq is on a two-day tear, surging 5% after the Federal Reserve announced another 0.75% interest rate increase and GDP data showed another quarter of negative growth. Impressive, to be sure, but a move overshadowed by some of what we\\'ve seen in crypto markets this week. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) has surged over 12% since Wednesday morning, with ethereum (ETH-USD) up by more than twice this amount. All of which fits the framework of an environment The Macro Compass argues can be defined by investors saying — \"the riskier the better.\" Since the market\\'s most recent bottom on June 16, we\\'ve seen many of the styles and sectors that led us into bear market territory lead us towards a potential way out. And this week\\'s post-earnings reactions from names like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) show investors are still itching to give companies the benefit of the doubt. All of which makes the action in names like Meta Platforms (META) more painful. Which brings us back to bitcoin. In May, bitcoin\\'s correlation with stocks peaked at 0.82. The max correlation for any asset pair is 1, meaning these assets would move the same direction by the same magnitude. But this correlation between stocks and crypto peaked as both markets were on the way down after the implosion of stablecoin Terra.

Following the Federal Reserve's Wednesday announcement to raise interest rates by 75 basis points, bitcoin climbed as high as $24,292 early Friday morning, and is up more than 20% since its most recent low of $18,728 on July 2. Ether has more than doubled bitcoin’s gains over the same period, jumping as much as 57% from $1,009 to $1,737 as of Friday morning, a price the second-largest cryptocurrency hasn't seen since credit dried up for dozens of crypto firms at the beginning of June. “Really what’s driving all of this is expectations about future inflation or lack thereof,” Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX founder and CEO told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. “When you see market movements, a lot of what’s happening is that there’s been a shift in sentiment about whether monetary supply is increasing or decreasing and that’s all coming from [how] the Fed responds,” Bankman-Fried added. To be sure, the total market capitalization for all crypto assets is still down roughly 60% from its peak reached in November 2021. But cryptocurrency prices have rebounded over the first half of July with fresh buying having sent the sector's total market cap back above $1 trillion. The 200-day moving average (DMA), which traders use as a technical gauge for whether an asset's trend is broadly higher or lower, still sits far above current levels and is declining for both bitcoin and ether.
